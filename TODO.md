## status and open questions

   * questions on geometry
       * ask about the overlapping cladding and core volumes (Marco or Marco)    
       * what is the difference between ru_l and fiber_env_l?
   * where are SiPMs? On one, or two sides of fibres? it seems on both sides
   * I cannot modify the geometry from vis.mac even if the messenger is setup, why? 
   * understand how to setup the sensitive detectors
     * why is there only one single SiPM sensitive detector? 
       as there's only one logical volume for the SiPM
     * how do I separate the reading from different SiPM's? GetCopyNumber
   * check what sensitive volumes are --> OFOS_OpticalPhotonSD
   * multithreading removed, that was not the problem though
